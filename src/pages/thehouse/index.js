                        House of Assets is a private society.
                        <br />
                        A new kind of society that we build together. A society for the metaverse. By the community.

                        Starting with a collection of 10,000 Boomies that give you membership access to The House. It starts with exclusive assets, NFT drops, investments and much more that will be revealed over time.
                        <br />
                        House of Assets is your identity in the metaverse â€” let's build together.

                        The House is a corner of the internet where art, community, and culture fuse to create magic. The lines between the physical and digital worlds are blurring and the rules are being rewritten.
